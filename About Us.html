<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p>We strive to offer the best muffins in town. Every Tuesdays and Fridays we have promotions, 
when you buy 3 or more muffins you get one free. On Mondays, you can actually buy 4 muffins for the price of 2. 
We will do this to attract the customer and give them what they as our customers want.
